If you have read my 'About Me' section, you know that I am a Software Engineer, but I did not major in Computer Science. 
Most people that hear what my degree is in are quite surprised. 
There aren't many people that make the transition from studying Psychology and Business + working in marketing to becoming a Software Engineer.
